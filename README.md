#SpringBoard Internship
This project involved developing a robust machine learning system to classify online job postings as either Real (0) or Fraudulent (1), directly addressing the critical challenge of online recruitment scams. The process began with extensive data preparation on the Fake Job Postings Dataset (approx. 17.8K records), which involved rigorous text cleaning (removing noise like HTML, URLs, and punctuation), followed by core Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Tokenization and Lemmatization for textual normalization. We also explored foundational NLP concepts like Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging to enrich syntactic context. The cleansed text was then transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a method crucial for giving higher weight to discriminatory keywords common in fake postings. For modeling, we established a baseline with Logistic Regression (using balanced class weights to handle data imbalance) and advanced to ensemble methods like Decision Tree and Random Forest for improved predictive performance. Finally, the models were critically evaluated using metrics specifically tailored for imbalanced data, such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with a focus on maximizing Recall for the fraudulent class to ensure reliable detection of scams.
